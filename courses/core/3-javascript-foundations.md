# Advice

* He says semi colons are necessary and semi colons are good. They're not necessary anymore in modern javascript.
* Javascript syntax has a lot in common with C, C++, Java and many other languages :smile:
* These days we don't tend not to use while loops or for loops. We'll use arrays and a collections library instead. (Like `.map`)
* alert, prompts and confirms are cool. But it's obviously not what we'll be using later.
* undefined, null is a pain. There are some libraries which help us do undefined and null checking later :smile:
* Javascript has versions (although Chrome, for example, tends to release them feature by feature all the time). Version ES5 is the current version, but ES6 is a lot better :smile:
* Javascript (Especially ES5) has a lot of things programmers don't like / find hard. ES6 helps alot of these things.
  * Variable scope
  * When you load a .js file `<script src="myScript.js" />` it just runs...
  * All global variables in any of your .js files are accessible globally, so you can access them from anywhere. (Try not to use global vars...)
  * There are ~3 ways to declare a function :(

* We will use arrays. But we won't use the manipulation methods much e.g. `pop` or `push`. We'll use collection libraries :smile:
